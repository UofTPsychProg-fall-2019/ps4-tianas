## Hello! A note about my final submission (submitted November 5, 2019).

I've included three versions of my work:

* A Markdown file - if possible, please read this one because it's the clearest. I used chunks of code here because my code is a bit long, and want to ensure it's not confusing.
* A Python file - if you'd like to open it in that file format.
* A Text file - this is the .txt file of my description and code, but it's not really the most organized - sorry about that.

## Give us your pseudocode!
For this problem set, your task is to write out the pseudocode for the experiment you'll be implementing for assignment #1. Think about the logic of your experiment, if/how you want to counterbalance, the sequence of a trial, what measures you want to collect, and so on. Then, using pseudocode that makes sense to you, write it out in some sort of structured format (e.g., detailed paragraphs, bulleted sequence of operations, indented code-like commands). Just make sure it is both human readable and detailed. If you don't know all the details of your experiment, that is fine. Make something up that's sensible, but the closer you are to the experiment you will implement, the more helpful this assignment will be later on!

## Deliverables
Your submission should be 1 text file with:
1. A brief paragraph describing of your experiment
2. Pseudocode detailing the hierarchy of your experiment
