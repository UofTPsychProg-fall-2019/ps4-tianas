Hello! A note about my final submission (submitted November 5, 2019):

I've included three versions of my work:

* A Markdown file - if possible, please read this one because it's the clearest. I used chunks of code here because my code is a bit long, and want to ensure it's not confusing.
* A Python file - if you'd like to open it in that file format.
* A Text file - this is the .txt file of my description and code, but it's not really the most organized - sorry about that.
